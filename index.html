  <p>Omnia Ex Nihilo: Everything from nothing</p>
  <p>This is the basic principle of this particular studio: doing everything from publicly available resources, like the local library and things of that nature. All steps performed during the creation of this particular studio came from absolutely nothing. Or more accurately, it COULD come from absolutely nothing.</p>

  <p>Furtasma is more of an engine for others to build their own scenarios. It contains a character creator, a way to save characters, a way to save your progress, and a way to load in new scenarios that other users create. There is a default scenario for this game, and both the character creator, and the base scenario contains sexually explicit content.
